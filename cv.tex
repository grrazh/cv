% At the moment I have worked only 7.5 months. It is somewhat hard to evaluate my own performance, as I always think that I could have done so much more. Also, because I often tend to be interested in big, architecture-level changes, they go slower than I'd wish and it's harder to show. Nevertheless, since I joined the team I have done the following things:
% - maintainability improvements:
%   - reorganization of the code base
%     - decluttered repository toplevel
%     - cleaned up obsolete/abandoned branches (with automatic script to do that periodically)
%   - shrinked application bundle size twice (from 100mb to 50mb), which made deployments noticeably faster
%   - formulated automated versioning strategy in a way that does not require conscious effort from the developers, and is helpful for the server team to understand amount and severity of changes.
%   - proposed and added jvm memory consumption metrics, so we can see when GC happens and can understand it's implications on the dynamic behavior of the system
% - productivity
%   - automation of manual deployments. allows developers to test changes in ddev/adev/staging faster. instead of commiting, and clicking your way through bamboo you can deploy your local code tree directly with just one command.
%   - automation of versioning. Developers don't need to review all code changes since last version change and manually edit the version. After a while you don't even notice that you are doing versioning.
% - Readability and understandability of the code
%   - Insisted on starting doing proper code reviews. Found a compromise to start doing that after going 100% GA
%   - created a glossary of terms for increasing consistency and noticing ambiguities in naming we use, so that we can improve it.
%   - have been doing code reviews. gave suggestions on improving naming
%   - insisted on strict adherence to our code style guide
% - Architecture
%   - Reworking build process (cleaned up a lot of obsolete stuff, simplified clojurescript and uberjar build process, working on splitting synchrony into smaller subprojects)
%   - Dockerization
%   - Grand vision of splitting synchrony into smaller, easier to maintain pieces
%     - part 1: clustering
%       - extracted into synchrony-clustering microservice
%       - synchrony part is decoupled from the mechanism of getting list of active nodes, so hazelcast-based (or even completely static) implementation can be created for ConfServer synchrony, keeping synchrony identical between cloud and server. 
%     - part 2: accepting client connections and routing them to correct synchrony processing nodes
%       - have been accepted as a valuable option by Tobias
%       - prerequisites for the implementation have been tested
%       - turned out impossible to implement due sticky sessions being unsupported for websockets in AWS, and direct connections to nodes being disallowed by micros
%       - investigated an option to use Kubernetes (at that moment it turned out to not be ready for deploying production services)
%       - have recently found a way to overcome the limitations of aws/micros, so desired architecture could be implemented in a relatively straightforward way. will pursue it after finishing rework of the build pipeline 
%   - Led Synchrony Architecture Bootcamp (02/05/2017).
%   - Participated in architecture review (05/06/2017).
% - Got into Ship-It finals
% Other than that I have participated in interviewing potential candidates, have been helping with onboarding, have been pairing with other team members, doing on-call job, and working with support to investigate customer issues (sometimes during after hours). 
% Regarding company values - most of the stuff above is BTCYS, which is the value that resonates the most with me. Help with onboarding, pairing, substituting other team members for on-call time is PAAT. Working with support investigating customer issues, and regular work to make Synchrony more stable/reliable is DFTC. I think that calling up on issues with the codebase and Tobias could be labeled as OCNB, though I'm still unsure if my actions were right.

\begin{rSubsection}{Filemporium}{July 2015 - December 2016}{Lead Clojure Developer}{Remote via Upwork}
\item Setup temporary deplyoment via docker and dokku
\item Revised architecture in a way that drastically simplified client-side
  state management and allowed live page update of all active user sessions
\item Reengineered project build system using boot (previously leiningen were used).
  Fixed project build time (full recompilation now takes just a couple of minutes
  instead of an hour). Adjusted project code to work with reloaded workflow.
\item Documented project structure, project-specific code conventions, technical decisions, troubleshooting, and Amazon S3 project-specific step-by-step configuration guide
\item Implemented production-ready multiserver setup with zero-downtime deployment using NixOS/NixOps and Consul
\item Refactored most of the project, implemented lots of functionality and fixed lots of bugs (e.g added
  config schema validation, cleaned up garbage logging (like {\tt (println "!!! FOO:" x)}) and implemented
  propper configurable logging throughout the system, implemented chunked file upload with automatic reconnection, etc.)
\item Interviewed potential candidates
\item Regularly did code reviews
\item Did pair programming (to assist others with complicated tasks, to share project knowledge, to get
  back on track when I'm stuck)
\item Fired a programmer that have been writing terrible code
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Filemporium}{May 2015 - July 2015}{Clojure Developer}{Remote via Upwork}
\item Automated design updates
\item Added compile-time template checks to kioo templating library to ensure
  component correctness after design update
\item Added support for using arbitrary npm libraries from ClojureScript code (to be
  able to utilize existing js React components)
\item Started writing project documentation. Documented actions needed to setup
  a project, update design, add npm library

  \begin{list}{$\cdot$}{\leftmargin=0em} % \cdot used for bullets, no indentation
    \itemsep -0.5em \vspace{-0.5em} % Compress items in list together for aesthetics
  \item I decided to tie my work to computers when I was 5.
  \item First program in BASIC at age of 11, first HTML and JavaScript at 12, first program in Pascal at 13.
  \item I started playing with Linux when I was 14 (it was Mandrake 10 in 2005)
  \item I use Dvorak keyboard layout
  \item I use Archlinux with lots of handwritten scripts and i3 tiling window manager as my work environment.
  \item I tend to automate everything I could.
  \item I started using Emacs at 2010 and never looked back. Since 2011 I use it with Evil (vim emulation layer)
  \item I have dozens of personal opensource projects and have contributed to
        upstream of at least 20 other.
  \item Some time ago I was passionate about japanese animation, so I learned
        some japanese and passed an international exam (JLPT4 certificate). I remember myself
        learning Esperanto and Toki Pona, and now I am learning Lojban.
  \item I am an active ACM and ACM SIGPLAN member.
  \item One of my primary interests is programming languages. I am still thinking of one
        that would be perfectly expressive. I have plans for PhD in that field.
  \item I write tests very rarely and when I feel I wish to write one, I know that
    I should search for more simple solution that will be obviously working and not
    require any iterative validation. I do not believe that writing tons
    of tests may lead to good system design. More often it leads to design that is hard to change
    in any meaningful way. Instead of going test-first I go think-first, and don't start writing
    code until I clearly know what I'm going to write and why.
